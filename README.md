## Overview

RasPiCube is a portable, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W(H)-powered Rubik's Cube timer and scramble generator. This DIY project combines a high-resolution (320x240, pretty high) display, 7-segment timer, touch sensor input, and RGB status indicators to create a timing solution for cubers like myself.

### Features

- **Scramble Generation**: Automatically generates random, valid 3x3 Rubik's Cube scrambles
- **Dual Display System**: 
  - 2-inch IPS LCD Display (240Ã—320) for scramble and statistics
  - 6-digit 7-segment display for precise timing readout (3d.p.)
- **Touch Sensor Input**: Capacitive touch controls for a competition-like solving experience 
- **Visual Status Indicators**: RGB LED provides clear visual feedback of the project's status
- **Statistics**: Calculates and displays session averages (ao5, ao12)
- **Battery Powered**: Portable with a 18650 lithium-ion battery
